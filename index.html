                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p align="justify">Moss is virtual 3D artefacts that mimics the attachment of moss on biological items. 
                    It is a collection of simulation and recreation of natural ecological interdependence created with Diffusion-limited aggregation algorithm and geometry nodes.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">As a nature enthusiast, I always observe unusually shaped trees. 
                    I noticed that many trees have tumours of various sizes connected to their trunks.
                     Although most of them have little effect on the tree's growth, the attachment relationship makes me question how such an ecosystem is built.
                    </p>
                <p align="justify">Nature's mystery and beauty are beyond description, and the rules of growth are tinted with unpredictability, displaying a mystical and dynamic. 
                    The project was inspired by these trees (p1/p2/p3), using the moss — lichen plant as a case study to try to simulate and explain this dependency in computational art way.
                     Lichens, other people's clothing, are always growing on the surface of other items. 
                    Typically, Mosses, in their juvenile phases, often attach themselves to the surfaces of other things via wind, and then reproduce asexually, develop, and spread, producing a miniature ecosystem that lives in symbiosis with the dependents. </p>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                
                <p align="justify">Dependencies usually require two objects. 
                    Both the moss and the attached object to which it is connected are developed individually and then integrated in this design.</p>

                    <p align="justify">Firstly, the moss code is divided into three sections: simulating attachment movements, defining attachment positions and volume modelling. 
                        In this process, I referred to Daniel Shiffman's Diffusion-Limited Aggregation and Andy's boids and Multi-agent System, and Khamurai's volumetric modelling.</p>
                        
                    <p align="justify">Second, I studied tutorials provided by Benny Govaerts and Default Cube for modelling tree trunks.
                            I utilised two techniques to trunk modelling: surface modelling to replicate a true trunk shape and curve extension to create a trunk form with organic features.</p>
